# GIF Search Application

# Author: Timur Iagudin

# Overview/Description
This project is a web application that allows users to search for GIFs using the Giphy API based on their input. Users can enter a search query (consisting of Latin alphabet characters and numbers) and retrieve GIFs related to their query. The application dynamically displays the fetched GIFs along with their titles in the results section. It also provides feedback messages for invalid inputs or errors during the API request.

# Functionality
Users can enter a search query in the input field.
Pressing Enter or clicking a search button triggers a request to the Giphy API.
GIFs related to the search query are fetched and displayed in the results section.
Messages are displayed for invalid inputs (non-Latin characters) and network errors.
Total count of GIFs found is displayed if results are found.

# Technologies Used
HTML: Used for structuring the UI elements.
CSS: Used for styling the application to improve visual appeal and user experience.

# How to Use
Enter a search query (only Latin alphabet characters and numbers) in the input field.
Press Enter or click the search button to see GIFs related to your query.

# Ideas for Future Improvement
Pagination: Implement pagination for the GIFs to handle large result sets more efficiently.
Search Suggestions: Provide autocomplete or search suggestions based on popular or recent searches.
Advanced Filtering: Allow users to filter search results by categories, tags, or content types (e.g., trending, latest, specific topics).
